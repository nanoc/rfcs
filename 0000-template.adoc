= Lazy-load items
:start_date: 2016-01-03
:rfc_issue: (leave this empty)
:nanoc_issue: (leave this empty)

== Summary

Do not load all items into memory, but compile them one-by-one.

== Motivation

* reduce memory pressure

* start compiling as soon as possible rather than loading everything first. a step towards parallelization. allow data sources to prefetch items asynchronously

Why are we doing this? What use cases does it support? What is the expected outcome?

== Detailed design

This is the bulk of the RFC. Explain the design in enough detail for somebody familiar with Nanoc to understand, and for somebody familiar with Nanocâ€™s internals to implement. This should get into specifics and corner-cases, and include examples of how the feature is used.

== Drawbacks

Why should we *not* do this?

== Alternatives

What other designs have been considered? What is the impact of not doing this?

== Unresolved questions

What parts of the design are still to be discussed?
