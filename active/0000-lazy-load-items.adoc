== Summary

Do not load all items into memory, but compile them one-by-one.

== Motivation

* Loading all items in memory is problematic in terms of memory pressure. For large sites, Nanoc can run out of memory, or spend a large amount of time in the garbage collector footnote:[CRuby 2.2 has a generational garbage collector, which helps alleviate this problem. I have not compared performance of CRuby 2.1 and 2.2 in terms of GC performance yet, however.].

* Loading items one-by-one allows compilation to start right away, rather than waiting for all data to have been loaded into memory. With data sources that pre-fetch data, I/O wait time could be reduced to a minimum. This approach will also get us a step closer towards parallelism footnote:[CRubyâ€™s global interpreter lock will prevent us from gaining much here, but it will benefit other Ruby implementations that do not have such a lock, such as JRuby.].
